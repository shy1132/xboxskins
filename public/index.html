        <h2>www.xbox-skins.net</h2>
        <hr>
        this is a replacement of the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050204043516/http://www.xbox-skins.net/index.php?dlcategory=5" target="_blank">www.xbox-skins.net</a> downloader for UnleashX<br>
        it was reverse engineered and rewritten by me to enable built-in skin and preview downloading again on UnleashX<br>
        there is no frontend for this website, only the backend services for UnleashX's skin & preview downloaders<br><br>
        full skin downloader support with an organized & sorted skin archive (originally found <a href="https://archive.org/details/XBUXSkins" target="_blank">here</a>)<br>
        full preview downloader support with game previews (originally found <a href="https://1fichier.com/dir/0VjW41tf" target="_blank">here</a>)<br>
        most of the skins are from the original www.xbox-skins.net (around 2004 - 2008 i believe), but i would like to maybe
        someday add modern skins (not a guarantee)<br>
        <hr>
        to use the skin downloader, go to system > skins, press Y, and then select "Xbox-Skins.net"<br>
        then, choose skins to download (preview it with the black button), then press the start button to download
        <hr>
        to use the preview downloader, navigate to a game, press start, select "edit item", scroll to preview, press start,
        and select "Download Online"<br>
        to actually see the preview, use a skin that supports them (like UnleashRed), you can find it in the skin downloader :)<br>

        <h3>troubleshooting:</h3>
        <h4>skin downloader:</h4>
        if, previously (before november 11th, 2023), your xbox locked up after downloading a skin, this should now be
        fixed<br>
        if you just get an empty skin list (or an HTTP 404 error), make sure you're choosing "Xbox-Skins.net", and not
        "AllXboxSkins.com"<br>
        if it says "Downloaded 0 Skins" after downloading a skin, make sure the drive your <i>Skins</i> folder is in
        (usually <b>E:</b>) has enough storage space, and make sure that you're running UnleashX off of a hard drive as your
        main dashboard<br><br>
        <h4>preview downloader:</h4>
        if clicking "Download Online" does nothing, simply try again, it's an UnleashX bug<br>
        if it says "Can't find downloadable content for X", it's likely a homebrew game or not in the preview index (which i
        don't plan to add to)<br>
        previews inherently have somewhat bad quality, it's hard to encode an xmv and not have it be too big to download or
        too high quality for UnleashX to play<br>
        <hr>
        <h3>disclaimer:</h3>
        i did not make UnleashX, this is just a hobby project to bring back xbox-skins.net functionality on UnleashX<br>
        i did not make any of the skins here, ALL of them are from the www.xbox-skins.net archive on archive.org<br>
        i am unable to add features to the UnleashX side of this (e.g. a search feature, or a sorting feature) since all
        unleash does is ask this website for a list of skins
