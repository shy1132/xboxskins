    <h2>unofficial UnleashX skin downloader</h2>
    <hr>
    this is a replacement of the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050204043516/http://www.xbox-skins.net/index.php?dlcategory=5" target="_blank">www.xbox-skins.net</a> downloader for UnleashX<br>
    this was reverse engineered by me to allow for skin and preview downloading again on the custom dashboard<br>
    there is no frontend for this website, only the backend apis for UnleashX's skin & preview downloaders<br><br>
    full skin downloader support with an organized & sorted skin archive (originally found <a href="https://archive.org/details/XBUXSkins" target="_blank">here</a>)<br>
    full preview downloader support with game previews (originally found <a href="https://1fichier.com/dir/0VjW41tf" target="_blank">here</a>)<br>
    there are currently no plans to add new skins, only preserve the old ones for now<br>
    <hr>
    to use the skin downloader, go to system > skins, press y, and then select "Xbox-Skins.net"<br>
    <hr>
    to use the preview downloader, navigate to a game, press start, select "edit item", scroll to preview, press start, and select download online<br>
    to actually see the preview, use a skin that supports them (like UnleashRed), you can find it in the skin downloader :)<br>
